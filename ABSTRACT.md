The **Perrenial Plants Detection** dataset's author discusses the automation of weed removal in the cultivation of perennial plants. Currently, manual weed removal is a weekly chore for the entire plant population, involving repetitive and physically demanding tasks. In his notebook, he seeks to address two primary questions:

1. How reliable can weed be detected by using optical RGB inspection in combination with a state-of-the-art machine learning model?
2. When building the dataset, does it help to additionally provide a keypoint that marks the centre of the plant to later automatically identify the centre of the plant?

Over a span of seven weeks, from mid-April to June, images were collected at a plant nursery in southern Germany using a Fuji X-T2 camera, generating 392 images of 24MP (4000x6000px) resolution.

The dataset is divided into two parts: one for weed classification and another for keypoint detection, with some overlapping images.
