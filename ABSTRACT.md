The author of the **Perrenial Plants Detection** dataset explores automating weed removal in perennial plant cultivation, which currently involves physically demanding manual labor. They aim to answer two key questions: 1) Can optical RGB inspection combined with advanced machine learning reliably detect weeds? 2) Does providing a plant center keypoint in the dataset aid in automatic center identification?

Over seven weeks, images were collected at a southern German plant nursery using a Fuji X-T2 camera, resulting in 392 high-resolution images (24MP, 4000x6000px). The dataset includes sections for weed classification and keypoint detection, with some image overlap.
