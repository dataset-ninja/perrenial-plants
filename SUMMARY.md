**Perrenial Plants Detection** (Perrenial Plants Detection) is a dataset for instance segmentation tasks. It is applicable or relevant across various domains.

The dataset consists of 392 images with 1159 labeled objects belonging to 14 different classes including *not identified*, *weed*, *Stellaria media,* and other: *Veronica arvensis, Cirsium arvense, Poa anua, Matricaria chamomilla, Taraxacum officinale, Sagina subulata, woods, Cardamine hirsuta, Elymus repens, Artiplex oblongifolia, and Portulaca oleracea*.

Each image in the Perrenial Plants Detection dataset has pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 2 (1% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds0* (392 images). The dataset was released in 2021.

Here are the visualized examples for each of the 14 classes:
